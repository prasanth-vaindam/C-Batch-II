Instructions performed in Machine are written is machine Language
Generally Machine Code is in Binary (0,1) - This is also know as Target Code
Decimal to Binary Conversion Recap 

Execution means to run the code or perform the Instructions by the C.P.U (or) Machine
Inorder for the CPU to exceute the Target Program the source Code written in HLL like C must be compiled to Target Code using a C Compiler e.g. GCC

Execute on Greeting.c the very First C Program
Showed Target exe file generated by C Compiler

What's the meaning of %2d, %6.2f, or anything similar in C programming?
---------
The format string's format is %[flags][width][.precision][length]specifier. %2d will print the parameter right aligned as int with at least 2 characters. %6.2f will print the floating-point value with 2 decimal places and at least 6 characters in integer part.

In C programming, the % symbol is used as a format specifier in functions like printf() and scanf() to define the format of the output or input. Here are a few common format specifiers and their meanings:

%d: This is used for printing integers. For example, %2d specifies that the integer should be padded with spaces on the left to make it at least 2 characters wide.
%f: This is used for printing floating-point numbers. For example, %6.2f specifies that the floating-point number should be printed with a total width of 6 characters, including 2 decimal places.
%6.2f: This is a combination of two format specifiers. The number 6 specifies the minimum field width, including the decimal point and any padding characters, while the number 2 after the decimal point specifies the number of digits to be printed after the decimal point.
